(Please accept this job only if you are a native speaker of English.)

You will be shown two CANDIDATE WORD PAIRS. You must pick the candidate 
PAIR whose words are MOST RELATED IN MEANING.

For example, given the pair candidates "wallet-moon" and "car-automobile", 
you should choose the latter. 

Sometimes, both candidate pairs have words that are related in meaning, 
and you should pick the one where you think the words are more strongly 
related (both "wheels-car" and "dog-race" have somewhat related word pairs, 
but the first one is to be preferred as every car has wheels but not every 
dog is involved in a race). Sometimes, neither pair contains words closely 
related, and you should in such case pick the one that contain words at 
least slightly more related (neither "auction-car" nor "cup-asphalt" are 
closely related pairs, but you might pick the first because fancy vintage 
cars are sold at auctions).
